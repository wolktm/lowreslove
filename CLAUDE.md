I would like to make a simple app for android. 
The idea is to take or convert existing picture to a low resolution (ie 256x128, it should keep aspect ratio) and low color count 8 colors depth:
- user selects a photo
- image is resized
- user selects from predefined 8-color paletes
- image is converted to selected palete
- image is resized *8 to make it look good in modern screens
- result is visible in preview 

## UI
- one screen interface 
- upper half of the screen is a button for selecting a photo 
- once the photo is selected it will become a preview for changes applied 
- lower half is a selection of paleted of 8 colors
- when user taps on the preview, image is exported
- interface shoule be low resolution retro style
